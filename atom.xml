    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>My experiences as a student at Hackbright Academy began on October 1st, 2012. <a href="http://www.hackbrightacademy.com/">Hackbright Academy</a>, it is a 10-week intensive program that trains women with problem solving mindset but without the traditional computer science background to become software engineers and web developers. It is currently run by three amazing people: Christian, Charles and David (<a href="https://twitter.com/chriszf">@chriszf</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/cruhland">@cruhland</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/davjphillips">@davjphillips</a>, respectively). I am one of the 16 women in the Hackbright&#8217;s second batch.</p>

<p>I find the immersive coding environment to be conducive to and befitting such rigorous learning, but impossible without instructors such as Christian and Charles. They both have two invaluable qualities of a teacher: ability to explain complex things with clarity and patience, and genuine interest and responsibility with which they approach educating.</p>

<p>In college, I felt that whenever I got engrossed in a project or a subject, my engagement with other courses and assignments suffered. At the moment, I am truly glad to be able to focus on, theoretically, one thing: learning to code well in Python. 10 weeks won&#8217;t cover everything I want to learn, especially not the entire 4-year curriculum traditional computer science majors undergo. With stacks of tools and terminologies to familiarize myself with, skills to build, and Hacker News articles to read, and networking to be done, it is and will be certainly overwhelming at times. But I realize that quality of learning and improving my qualifications as a coder is far more important than quantity of information I can hash out.</p>

<p>This blog will trace my learning during Hackbright and beyond. It will focus on my codes, endeavours to debug and refactor them, and personal thoughts on both coding and non-coding alike. Through blogging, I can put my inspirations to a productive use, as I transition from a thinker and an idealist to an builder and an engineer. Any comments or feedback are always welcome!</p>

<p>It&#8217;s important to mention that <a href="http://natashatherobot.com/">Natasha&#8217;s blog</a> was an inspiration for this blog. I find it inspiring that you can be a learner and a teacher at the same time, empowering other beginner coders by sharing learning experiences and resources. In my blog, I hope to do my best to use my fresh learner&#8217;s perspective to help other self-learners out there, as Natasha and few others have generously done. I want to pass along few of Natash&#8217;s invaluable tips that helped me during my first week at Hackbright.</p>

<ol>
<li>What type of learner are you?</li>
<li>How can you optimize your resources to benefit your learning style?</li>
<li>Take responsibility of your own learning!</li>
</ol>


<p>To conclude, here is my present reply to the above question: Can I become a software engineer? Yes&#8211;only if I make it happen. <br>
